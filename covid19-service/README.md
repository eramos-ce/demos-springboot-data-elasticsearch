# COVID19 Service

Simple app to show how to get an Elasticsearch backed service.

## TODO
* Would like to create docker-compose yml with ES and Kibana
* Would like to create separate service to consume from Solace's COVID19 stream documented [here](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/covid19-stream-processors)
